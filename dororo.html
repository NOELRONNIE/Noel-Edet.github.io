Dororo, a young orphan thief, meets Hyakkimaru, a powerful ronin. Hyakkimaru's father, a greedy feudal lord, had made a pact with 12 demons, offering his yet-unborn son's body parts in exchange for great power. Thus, Hyakkimaru - who was born without arms, legs, eyes, ears, a nose or a mouth - was abandoned in a river as a baby. Rescued and raised by Dr. Honma, who equips him with artificial limbs and teaches him sword-fighting techniques, Hyakkimaru discovers that each time he slays a demon, a piece of his body is restored. Now, he roams the war-torn countryside in search of demons.

The 2019 Dororo anime series is based on the manga of the same name by Osamu Tezuka. The adaptation departs from the source material in several ways, but follows the basic premise of the manga; A young ronin named Hyakkimaru along with a young urchin, Dororo, must face multiple demons in Sengoku-era Japan who have stolen his various body parts in order to get them back.
The 24-episode series aired January 7 to June 24, 2019 on Tokyo MX, BS11, and Jidaieki Senmon Channel, and is streamed exclusively worldwide on Prime Video.[1][2] Kazuhiro Furuhashi directs the series, with Yasuko Kobayashi handling series composition, Satoshi Iwataki handling character designs, and Yoshihiro Ike composing the music. Twin Engine produces the series.[3] The opening theme "Kaen" (火炎) is performed by Queen Bee, while the ending theme "Sayonara Gokko" (さよならごっこ) is performed by Amazarashi. The second opening "Dororo" (どろろ) is performed by Asian Kung-Fu Generation and the second ending theme "Yamiyo" (闇夜) is performed by Eve.
The series reinterprets some stories which also appear in the 1969 TV series, for example The Story of Bandai which was spread across two episodes in the first series, but completed within one episode in the 2019 series.
