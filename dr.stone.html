        After five years of harboring unspoken feelings, high-schooler Taiju Ooki is finally ready to confess his love to Yuzuriha Ogawa. Just when Taiju begins his confession however, a blinding green light strikes the Earth and petrifies mankind around the world— turning every single human into stone.
<br>
        Several millennia later, Taiju awakens to find the modern world completely nonexistent, as nature has flourished in the years humanity stood still. Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who has been active for a few months. Taiju learns that Senkuu has developed a grand scheme—to launch the complete revival of civilization with science. Taiju's brawn and Senkuu's brains combine to forge a formidable partnership, and they soon uncover a method to revive those petrified.
        
        However, Senkuu's master plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged by those who awaken. All the while, the reason for mankind's petrification remains unknown.

        Dr. Stone (stylized as Dr.STONE) is a Japanese manga series written by Riichiro Inagaki and illustrated by the South Korean artist Boichi. It has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 2017, with its chapters collected in twenty tankōbon volumes as of April 2021. The story follows teenage scientific genius Senku Ishigami, who plans to rebuild civilization after humanity was mysteriously petrified for 3,700 years. Viz Media licensed the manga in North America. Shueisha began to simulpublish the series in English on the website and app Manga Plus since January 2019.
        An anime television series adaptation by TMS Entertainment aired from July to December 2019. A second season of the anime series focused on the "Stone Wars" arc aired from January to March 2021. A third season has been announced.
        <br>
        As of April 2021, the Dr. Stone manga had over 10 million copies in circulation. In 2019, Dr. Stone won the 64th Shogakukan Manga Award for the shōnen category. It has also been noted for being scientifically accurate.
        Beginning in April 5738 CE, it's been over 3,700 years since a mysterious flash petrified nearly all human life. A 15-year-old genius named Senku Ishigami is suddenly revived to find himself in a world where all traces of human civilization have been eroded by time. Senku sets up a base-camp and begins to study the petrified humans in order to determine the cause of the event, as well as a cure.
        <br>
        Over the next 6 months, Senku's friend Taiju Oki wakes up and Senku learns their revival was made possible with nitric acid. With this discovery, they develop a compound that will allow them to instantly revive others. They begin by reviving a famous martial artist named Tsukasa Shishiō, and their classmate (and Taiju's crush) Yuzuriha Ogawa, with the goal of rebuilding civilization with a focus on science.
        Tsukasa ultimately reveals that he opposes Senku's idea of forming a new scientific civilization, believing the old world was tainted and should not be restored. Instead, he desires to establish a new world order based on power and strength, going so far as to destroy any petrified adults he encounters in order to prevent them from interfering with his goals.
        <br>
        After extorting the formula for the revival compound from Senku, Tsukasa attempts to murder him when he realized that Senku knows how to create weapons that he cannot defend against. Believing he successfully killed Senku, Tsukasa leaves to begin establishing his own faction in the Stone World.
        After recovering from his near death experience, Senku discovers a tribe of people already living on the planet and sees this as an opportunity to create his Kingdom of Science. These people are originally hesitant, but eventually learn the benefits that science can bring to their survival. Over time, Senku becomes more trusted by the tribe, eventually being taught of their past – where he discovers that the village was started by his adoptive father, along with five other astronauts, who were unaffected due to being in the International Space Station at the time of the petrification event.
        <br>
        Together with his new allies and friends, Senku's Kingdom of Science engages in a war with Tsukasa's clan, ultimately emerging victorious and affirming themselves as a force to be reckoned with. After the victory they discover that Senku's adopted father had left precious metals which can be used as catalysts to mass produce revival fluid in the nearby island which is now inhabited by a tribe known as the Petrification Kingdom, who possess the device used to petrify the world so long ago.
        <br>
        After gathering resources, like oil and metals, they have build a ship named Perseus. They set sail and arrived to the Petrification Kingdom within a few days. A member of the Ishigami village claimed to know the region, for he came from there himself. After they docked the ship, a few ventured to meet the islanders. The instant they came out, the whole crew in the ship was petrified, and was thrown to sea.
