        Many years ago, a Great Civil War ravaged Japan, leaving the country fragmented between two regions: Kansai and Kanto. In Kansai, a group of six Akudama carry out missions given to them by a mysterious black cat, while evading the police. But a dangerous journey is about to unfold when a civilian girl becomes twisted into the Akudama’s way of lie and witnesses their criminal drives.

        Akudama Drive (Japanese: アクダマドライブ, Hepburn: Akudama Doraibu) is a 2020 Japanese cyberpunk anime television series produced by Pierrot and Too Kyo Games. Set in a dystopian future in Kansai, the story follows criminals known as Akudama who are pursued by the government, though one of them is an ordinary citizen who decides to take a fake identity in order to survive. The series aired from October to December 2020. Their stated influences include Quentin Tarantino's works as well as the 1982 film Blade Runner. The director was also impressed by Kazutaka Kodaka's work on the Danganronpa visual novel series and thus wanted him to revise the anime. A manga adaptation is also being written. A total of six DVD and Blu-ray collected the twelve episode series in Japan. 
        <br>
        Critical response to the series was positive based on the cyberpunk setting as well as the handling of the main cast, most notably the lead Swindler. In a dystopian future where Kansai became a vassal state of Kantō, multiple highly skilled criminals, called Akudama, are sent a message from an anonymous client to free a death row prisoner named Cutthroat before he is executed. Four Akudama respond to the challenge and descend into Kansai Police Headquarters to earn a big payday.
        <br> However, once inside, they discover the job was part of a larger scheme by their client to make them work together on a bigger job: to infiltrate the Shinkansen and steal precious cargo from a vault at the front of the train. Roped into the job are an ordinary girl arrested on a minor charge but forced to keep up the appearance of a Swindler, and a low-level Hoodlum who was accidentally broken out of jail during the initial heist. The team must work together to finish the job and earn their large payday, all while keeping ahead of the Executioners from the Kansai Police on their tail.
