        A secret life is the one thing they have in common. At school, Hori is a prim and perfect social butterfly, but the truth is she's a brash homebody. Meanwhile, under a gloomy facade, Miyamura hides a gentle heart, along with piercings and tattoos. In a chance meeting, they both reveal a side they've never shown. Could this blossom into something new?

        Hori-san to Miyamura-kun (堀さんと宮村くん, lit. "Hori and Miyamura") is a Japanese shōnen web manga series written and illustrated by Hiroki Adachi, under the pseudonym Hero. It was self-published on Hero's website, Dokkai Ahen, from February 2007 to December 2011 in a four-panel format. The series received a print publication by Square Enix, who compiled the chapters in ten volumes under its imprint Gangan Comics from October 2008 to December 2011. Additional side-story chapters were compiled as Hori-san to Miyamura-kun Omake (堀さんと宮村くん おまけ). Since 2012, Hori-san to Miyamura-kun was adapted into an original video animation series.
