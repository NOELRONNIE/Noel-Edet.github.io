        Vinland Saga (Japanese: ヴィンランド・サガ, Hepburn: Vinrando Saga) is a Japanese historical manga series written and illustrated by manga author Makoto Yukimura. The series is published by Kodansha, and was first serialized in the youth-targeted Weekly Shōnen Magazine before moving to the monthly manga magazine Monthly Afternoon, aimed at young adult men. As of November 2019, the series has been compiled into twenty-three bound volumes. Vinland Saga has also been licensed for English-language publication by Kodansha USA.

        The title, Vinland Saga, would evoke associations to Vinland as described in two Norse sagas. Vinland Saga is, however, set in Dane-controlled England at the start of the 11th century, and features the Danish invaders of England, commonly known as Vikings. The story combines a dramatization of King Cnut the Great's historical rise to power with a revenge plot centered on the historical explorer Thorfinn, the son of a murdered ex-warrior who serves under a group of mercenaries responsible for the deed.
        A 24-episode anime television series adaptation by Wit Studio aired on NHK General TV from July to December 2019.
        Vinland Saga had over 5 million copies in circulation as of 2018. In 2012, the series won the 36th Kodansha Manga Award for Best General Manga.
